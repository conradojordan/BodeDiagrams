# BodeDiagrams

Python program that generates x random transfer functions (x being input by user) with y maximum order (y also being input by user).

After that it runs Matlab engine to generate the Bode diagrams of these transfer functions, and save them as image files, while also saving the transfer functions in a .txt file.

For the program to function, user must have installed Matlab engine API for Python, instructions here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html
